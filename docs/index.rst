TransferBench documentation
****************************
TransferBench is a utility capable of benchmarking simultaneous transfers between user-specified devices (CPUs/GPUs). A transfer is a single operation where an executor reads and adds values from source (SRC) memory locations, then writes the sum to destination (DST) memory locations. This simplifies to a simple copy operation when dealing with a single SRC/DST.
