TransferBench is a utility to benchmark simultaneous transfers between user-specified devices (CPUs or GPUs). A transfer is a single operation where an executor reads and adds values from source (SRC) memory locations, then writes the sum to destination (DST) memory locations.
This simplifies to a simple copy operation when dealing with a single SRC or DST.

The code is open and hosted at `<https://github.com/ROCm/TransferBench>`_.
